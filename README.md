Hi, I’m Lukas (@prw583),

this GitHub-account and its repositories down below serve as a display of what I learned in Python so far. Most of my knowledge stems from:
- The course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis" from the Department of Economics at Copenhagen University (Course Website: https://sites.google.com/view/numeconcph-introprog/home)
- DataCamp online courses (Website: https://www.datacamp.com/)


In Python I have mostly worked with the following packages: 
- numpy
- scipy
- sympy
- pandas
- yfinance
- matplotlib


I’m interested in furthering my knowledge. I’m currently learning more about different approaches when it comes to data science in Python and I am trying to get a better understanding of SQL using my DataCamp subscription.
